                        <p>The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
                            She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do better than the archons and adepti have done for them. In order to prove this, she works harder than anyone else.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Keqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year. To many, the millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this, viewing Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.
                            Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?                           
                            It is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent. From most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Keqing has fair skin and dark amethyst eyes, with oval cat-like pupils featuring diamond-shaped markings on the iris. Her light purple hair tied into waist-length twin-tails, topped by small odango-style buns resembling cat ears. There is also a small braid running along the side of her bangs.
                            She wears a pale lavender top with a high violet collar and ruffled dark blue skirt, layered under a deep violet overcoat. The opening of her overcoat is marked by a golden ornament, which has white flowers and purple and gold-accented feathers attached. The pattern of the feathers resembles the ones on the dangling backs of her long sleeves. In addition, she wears a golden hairpin, a tasseled choker, and dark gloves with lavender trim.</p>
