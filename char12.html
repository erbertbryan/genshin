                        <p>Meet Tartaglia — the cunning Snezhnayan whose unpredictable personality keeps people guessing his every move.
                            Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Tartaglia describes himself as "kind of a bad guy," living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos.[7] He is self-confident, extremely solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, no matter what methods he uses or how he obtains that power. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting particularly powerful enemies, even if it means he dies in the process,[6] and uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.
                            Because of his pride, Tartaglia is extremely reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or how much they go against his values. Combined with his straightforward nature, this makes him easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan could potentially harm innocents,[8] he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission — only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.                           
                            Amongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is an oddball. While his fellow Harbingers use clandestine operations and stay behind the scenes, Tartaglia prefers being front and center. On top of his lust for battle and tendency to cause havoc, he is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and, in even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, his coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and "intangible" methods. That said, he only resorts to such methods when he must — for he far prefers facing his enemies in one-on-one combat rather than luring them into traps.
                            </p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Tartaglia has short, choppy orange hair and dull blue eyes. He wears a red Fatui mask pulled off to one side of his head. He also wears a beaded earring with a red crystal on his left ear.
                            Tartaglia wears a grey jacket with dark red and light grey details, grey pants, and black boots and gloves. His jacket is open on one side to reveal a belt, which his Hydro Vision is attached to. He also wears a red banner that goes across his chest and over his left shoulder, which becomes infused with a wispy hydro effect when in the melee stance of his elemental skill Foul Legacy: Raging Tide.
