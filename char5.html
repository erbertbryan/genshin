                        <p>A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. Erudite, but prideful. Though she is often strapped for cash and lives a life of thrift, she is resolved to never use astrology for profit... It is this very resolution that has caused her to constantly fret about money.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects her master, although it is implied that she is also scared of them. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying and can even sense their intentions just from a single glance.
                            Being obsessed with astrology however gives Mona a sense of pride with her passion, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, often going without shelter or food for days on end. She does not tolerate those who disrespect her.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Mona has light skin, a curvy build, and pale green eyes. She also has long black hair which she wears in two pigtails, and wears a compass-like gold earring on her left ear. The ends of Mona's pigtails are decorated with two gold compass ornaments.
                            Mona wears a purple and black leotard with gold lining. She wears purple sleeves and black gloves, along with a short purple cloak with red lining, buttoned with a compass ornament hanging above her chest. On top of her head rests a purple witch hat, decorated with gold decals, black ribbon and another compass ornament. A similar one is seen wrapped around her right thigh.</p>
