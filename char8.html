                        <h1 class="white-text left-align flow-text"> Introduction</h1>
                        <p>The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.
                            Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads.
                            After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>In part due to her half-qilin heritage, Ganyu is usually very quiet and reserved. Both Xiangling and her father note that whenever she visits Wanmin Restaurant, she always eats vegetarian dishes by herself and in small quantities.[6] She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.[7]
                            Ganyu's duties with the Qixing often have her do considerable work compared to other members, but the load does not faze her. She gets along well with her fellow co-workers, who look up to her; likewise, she cares for her juniors and offers her knowledge to help them with any problem they might have. The massive amount of work Ganyu deals with often leaves her very little free time, and she has very few friends outside of work.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>As a half-human, half-adeptus (to be precise, half-Qilin) hybrid, Ganyu has characteristics of both regular people and features found only in the gods.
                            Ganyu takes the appearance of a young woman with purple eyes and long blue hair, which fades into a darker shade at the end. The styling of her hair is, similar to Kaeya, easy to mistake for a ponytail, but it is not actually tied back by anything. Though she mostly resembles a human, she has dark red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. Most people believe it to be a headdress of sorts.</p>
