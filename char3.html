                        <h1 class="white-text left-align flow-text"> Introduction</h1>
                        <p>As the wealthiest gentleman in Mondstadt, the ever-dapper Diluc always presents himself as the epitome of perfection. But behind the courteous visage burns a zealous soul that has sworn to protect Mondstadt at all costs, allowing him to mercilessly vanquish all who threaten his city.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Kaeya calls himself and Diluc "anti-heroes with attitude problems." Diluc was once a confident and passionate young man, dedicated to his work with the Knights of Favonius. But after his father's untimely death, Diluc grew aloof, bitter, and distant. He dislikes wasting time on idle talk and can easily grow impatient.
                            Diluc holds a particular resentment towards the Knights of Favonius, whom he calls "inefficient" and snubs at every opportunity. This bitterness stems from Inspector Eroch's handling of his father's death, and Diluc has not lessened his bitterness even after Eroch was discharged from the Knights as a traitor. He believes that the Knights' ineptitude means poses a danger to the city, and therefore decided to defend the city himself as a vigilante. Despite his animosity towards most of the knights, he believes that a few show potential.                            
                            He dislikes alcohol, claiming that the taste doesn't suit him.    
                            Despite his playful personality as Venti, he consciously behaves differently, treating himself (as Venti) and his true identity, the Anemo Archon, as two different entities. He speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his Anemo Archon persona.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Diluc has porcelain skin with a slim, athletic build, crimson red eyes, and scarlet-hued hair which is always worn in a messy ponytail that extends to his middle back.
                            Diluc wears a black shirt, a thin white vest, and a black ascot with a red gem. Over this he dons a black coat that is adorned with golden trimmings and tassels, ending with ebony fur-trims. He wears black pants which are embellished with chains on his right thigh; while his Vision, attached to a belt, is settled upon his left thigh. Diluc also wears gloves, which are black with crimson red undersides.</p>
