                        <p>Knights of Favonius Spark Knight! Forever with a bang and a flash! —And then disappearing from the stern gaze of Acting Grand Master Jean. Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas...But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Klee is an energetic and outgoing girl, with Jean remarking that she takes after her mother, Alice. She acts like a typical young girl - full of energy and loves playing with her friends. She has a particular talent for creating explosives (as bombs) and adores everything that blows up, such as Amber's Baron Bunny. Klee's definition of playing is throwing explosives all over the place; she is particularly fond of fish blasting. Klee always tries to comply with the "Favonius Survival Rulebook" whenever she goes out to play.
                            In part due to her young age, Klee can be easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context on, such as a "wine industry" monster or Diluc's grumpiness.                            
                            Despite being an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics generally cause Jean to send her to solitary confinement so she can think about her actions. She also appears to be quite oblivious to her reputation for creating powerful "treasures".[4] Even though she may be aware of her own actions, Klee also spends the time in solitary confinement developing more bombs in the process.                           
                            Klee loves her fellow knights as they always try to keep her happy, although she does have other friends outside of the organization, all of whom she enjoys spending time with. She is particularly fond of Kaeya and Albedo, the former giving her "survival rules" and the latter being very kind and patient with her.                           
                            </p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Klee is a small girl with pale skin and light red eyes. She has pale blonde hair, tied in pigtails with a prominent cowlick, and elf-like ears.
                            Klee wears a red coat with a darker red embellishment and keyhole shapes in the hem over a white dress and shorts, as well as a fluffy scarf with a pom-pom, gloves, knee socks, boots, and a brown messenger bag. Attached to this bag is Dodoco, a furry, woodland animal-shaped pom-pom made by her mother, and her Pyro Vision. Klee wears a large red newsboy cap, with a pin featuring a clover insignia and two white feathers.</p>
