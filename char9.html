                        <p>Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's funerary affairs.
                            She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.
                            Aside from this, she is also a talented poet whose many "masterpieces" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor unless she tells them or they are working with her.
                            Hu Tao enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Due to her eccentric and off the wall personality, many people who interact with Hu Tao are generally left a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi — whenever she is around or her name is mentioned to her, she loses her usually calm and polite demeanor, remarking that Hu Tao has a "punchable face" and that she wants to put her in the fridge.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Hu Tao has fair skin and scarlet eyes with flower- shaped pupils. She has long, dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips, which she keeps parted into twin ponytails. She wears a dark brown porkpie hat decorated with red plum blossoms and branches, along with an indigo tassel and a wooden talisman attached to the front.
                            Hu Tao wears a traditional red shirt with a mandarin collar and black shorts with gold accents under a dark coat. Her Pyro vision is embedded at the back of her coat, along with long rectangular coattails, a black collar and cuffs, and golden brooches attached underneath her coat's collar and waist. In addition, Hu Tao wears a pair of white socks with matching red blossoms along with low heeled dress shoes.</p>
