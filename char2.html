                        <p>A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new. Likes apples and lively places but is not a fan of cheese or anything sticky. When using his Anemo power to control the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant attitude and a liking to rhyming in his speech. He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, saying, "every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song." He is also quite bold, shown many times in both the manga and the game, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful. In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.
                            Venti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as the Anemo Archon. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt" three times. [5] Venti is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as Dandelion Wine and has a high tolerance to alcohol. Much to his disdain, the form he takes causes most bartenders to see him as a minor, but he gets around this by telling people to get drinks for him in return for his performances. He is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain there are no cats nearby.    
                            Despite his playful personality as Venti, he consciously behaves differently, treating himself (as Venti) and his true identity, the Anemo Archon, as two different entities. He speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his Anemo Archon persona.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Venti has fair skin and a slim build. Similar to the Anemo element, his eyes are aqua green. He has dark blue hair that borders on black, with short twin braids that fade into aqua at the tips. The aqua tips glow neon when he uses his abilities. The form he currently takes is modeled after a deceased friend who perished in the rebellion to liberate Old Mondstadt.
                            He wears a frilly white top with a corset-like leather midsection, along with teal shorts with gold embroidery, a matching teal cape held together by a deep blue and gold bow. He also wears white stockings with three gold diamond shapes along each leg and a beret-like hat with a Cecilia, which is his favorite flower. He carries a wooden lyre with blue strings imbued with the power of Anemo.</p>
