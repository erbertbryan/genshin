                        <p>Albedo — an alchemist based in Mondstadt, in the service of the Knights of Favonius.
                            "Genius," "Kreideprinz," or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.                            
                            The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire — acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.</p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Albedo is described as an amiable and popular figure in Mondstadt, as well as an alchemical genius. He pursues the “truth” of the world of Teyvat and seems to be able to create living organisms through his alchemical talents. Albedo is also apparently good with children, and even the rambunctious Klee listens to him.
                            Albedo is a talented artist and illustrates Xingqiu’s novels. He researches and studies whatever he is interested in, and his quickly changing interests have given Albedo a habit of leaving his paintings unfinished.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Albedo is a young man with bright teal eyes with three dots in his iris (similar to the alchemy table) and pale skin. He has ashy light blonde hair reaching below his shoulders, partially pulled back in a braided ponytail.
                            Albedo wears a long white coat with short sleeves, a black hood, black and gold details, a golden chain, and lining. Under this, he wears an indigo shirt and a pair of black shorts, along with plain black stockings, embellished thigh-high black boots with silver accents, and long black gloves with orange undersides and gold details, and also has a diamond-shaped gold marking on his neck and wears his vision on the collar of his shirt right below it.</p>
