                        <p>An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy. "Blessed" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it. Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later. But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...
                        </p>
                        <h1>Personality</h1>
                        <p>Qiqi has a quiet, yet polite demeanor when dealing with customers at the pharmacy. As a zombie, Qiqi has trouble retaining memories and can quickly forget about people if she doesn't continually reinforce herself with an impression of them. Although zombies have to be issued orders when awoken, because Qiqi had done so herself, she has to give herself orders in order to perform her duties. She takes her duties seriously, carrying a notebook in which she details everything she needs to do for the day, which also serves as a reminder incase she forgets something. She also strides to improve herself so she becomes less forgetful.</p>
                        <h1>Appearance</h1>
                        <p>Qiqi has light purple hair reaching her shoulders at the sides with a long plait in the back, pale skin, and magenta colored eyes. Her fingernails are black.
                            Qiqi usually wears purple themed clothing and has several talismans stuck on her. Her attire consists of a purple frock and a deep purple beret with a red-purple (magenta) tassel on top and her Cryo Vision embedded on the side. She also wears black heels and white stockings that are wrapped in mummy-like bandages.</p>
